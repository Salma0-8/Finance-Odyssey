# 📈 Quant Math Roadmap for Finance

---

## **Stage 1: Foundations (4–6 months)**

Before stochastic calculus or finance models, you need solid fundamentals.

### 🔹 Linear Algebra

* **Goal**: Understand matrices, eigenvalues, decomposition, vector spaces (essential for PCA, regression, risk modeling).
* **Resources**:

  * *Strang – Introduction to Linear Algebra* (applied, intuitive).
  * MIT OCW: Gilbert Strang lectures (free).
* **Topics**:

  * Vector spaces, bases, orthogonality
  * Eigenvalues & eigenvectors, spectral decomposition
  * Matrix factorizations (LU, QR, SVD)
  * Positive definite matrices (covariance matrices in finance)

---

### 🔹 Calculus & Real Analysis

* **Goal**: Comfort with differentiation, integration, limits, multivariable calculus.
* **Resources**:

  * Stewart – *Calculus* (practical, applied)
  * Rudin – *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* (for rigor later)
* **Topics**:

  * Single & multivariable calculus
  * Taylor expansions
  * Partial derivatives, gradients, Jacobians, Hessians
  * Optimization (Lagrange multipliers, convexity)

*(Directly useful for risk optimization, utility maximization, ML for finance).*

## **Stage 2: Probability & Statistics (4–6 months)**

### 🔹 Probability

* **Goal**: Build probability theory intuition + measure-theoretic foundations for stochastic processes.
* **Resources**:

  * Ross – *A First Course in Probability* (beginner → applied)
  * Blitzstein & Hwang – *Introduction to Probability*
  * Billingsley – *Probability and Measure* (advanced)
* **Topics**:

  * Random variables, distributions, expectation, variance
  * Law of large numbers, central limit theorem
  * Conditional probability, Bayes theorem
  * Generating functions, moment generating functions
  * Joint distributions, independence, covariance

---

### 🔹 Statistics

* **Goal**: Inference and estimation for data + model calibration.
* **Resources**:

  * Casella & Berger – *Statistical Inference*
  * Wasserman – *All of Statistics* (condensed, finance-friendly)
* **Topics**:

  * Point estimation (MLE, method of moments)
  * Confidence intervals, hypothesis testing
  * Regression (linear, logistic)
  * Time series basics (AR, MA, ARMA, ARCH/GARCH)

---

## **Stage 3: Advanced Probability & Measure Theory (3–4 months)**

* **Goal**: Transition from “undergrad” probability to measure-theoretic probability, needed for stochastic calculus.
* **Resources**:

  * Williams – *Probability with Martingales*
  * Chung – *A Course in Probability Theory*
* **Topics**:

  * σ-algebras, measurable functions
  * Expectation as Lebesgue integral
  * Martingales, stopping times
  * Convergence concepts (a.s., in probability, in distribution, L²)

---

## **Stage 4: Stochastic Calculus (6–8 months)**

### 🔹 Beginner-Friendly Start

* **Shreve – Stochastic Calculus for Finance I & II**
  Vol I: discrete-time, binomial models
  Vol II: continuous-time, Ito calculus, Black–Scholes, risk-neutral pricing

### 🔹 More Advanced

* **Karatzas & Shreve – Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus** (measure-theoretic depth)
* **Bjork – Arbitrage Theory in Continuous Time** (finance-focused, intuitive)
* **Mikosch – Elementary Stochastic Calculus with Finance in View**

### 🔹 Topics

* Brownian motion, filtration, adapted processes
* Ito’s lemma (multivariate)
* Stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
* Martingale representation theorem
* Girsanov’s theorem & change of measure
* Black–Scholes model derivation
* Interest rate models (Vasicek, CIR, HJM)

---

## **Stage 5: Mathematical Finance Integration (6–12 months)**

Now apply math tools to finance models.

### 🔹 Core Resources

* Neftci – *An Introduction to the Mathematics of Financial Derivatives*
* Joshi – *The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance*
* Baxter & Rennie – *Financial Calculus*
* Wilmott – *Paul Wilmott Introduces Quantitative Finance*

### 🔹 Topics

* Derivatives pricing (options, forwards, futures, swaps)
* Risk-neutral valuation
* Greeks and hedging
* PDE methods (heat equation ↔ Black–Scholes)
* Monte Carlo methods for pricing & risk
* Portfolio optimization (Markowitz, CAPM extensions)
* Advanced: Credit risk models, stochastic volatility (Heston), jumps (Merton, Lévy processes)

---

## **Stage 6: Applied & Computational Math for Quants**

Parallel with theory, you need computational skills:

* **Numerical Methods**:

  * Monte Carlo simulation (variance reduction)
  * Finite difference methods for PDEs
  * Optimization algorithms

* **Programming**:

  * Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, statsmodels)
  * C++ or Julia for performance
  * Machine learning methods (regression, SVM, neural nets in quant research)

* **Resources**:

  * Glasserman – *Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering*
  * Numerical Recipes (for algorithms)
  * Python for Finance (Yves Hilpisch)

# 🛠 Suggested Timeline (for a full roadmap)

* **Year 1**: Foundations (linear algebra, calculus, probability & stats basics)
* **Year 2 (first half)**: Measure theory + advanced probability → start stochastic calculus
* **Year 2 (second half)**: Stochastic calculus + finance integration (Shreve, Bjork, Wilmott)
* **Year 3+**: Specialize in asset pricing, risk, or ML for finance

👉 This roadmap takes \~2–3 years for mastery if studied deeply (faster if you already have strong math background).
