Nice — below is a practical, end-to-end roadmap you can follow from *zero → hireable* in Supply Chain Analytics. It’s organized by learning stages, concrete skills, recommended courses & books, industry certs, project ideas (with datasets), tools to learn, plus tables you can copy/save. I cite authoritative sources for the important courses/certs/datasets/tools so you can jump straight to them. (skills → courses → certs → projects → tables)

# 1) Stage-by-stage learning path (step-by-step)

> Each stage lists: **core skills**, **courses/resources**, **projects** you should complete, and **deliverables** to add to your GitHub/portfolio.

---

## Stage 0 — Orientation & learning plan (1 week)

* **Goal:** define focus (analytics for planning, transportation optimization, inventory analytics, or end-to-end).
* **Do:** set GitHub repo, LinkedIn headline, and a simple learning calendar (hours per week).
* **Deliverable:** GitHub repo scaffold + a 1-page roadmap README.

---

## Stage 1 — Foundations (0–2 months)

**Skills**

* Excel (advanced: pivot, power query), basic statistics, SQL (SELECT/JOIN/aggregations), basic supply-chain concepts (procurement, make, move, sell), business metrics (fill rate, lead time, on-time delivery).

**Recommended courses / reading**

* *MITx — Supply Chain Fundamentals* (edX) — excellent analytic perspective on logistics & flows. ([edX][2])
* Any practical SQL course (Mode, DataCamp, free SQLZoo/Khan) and Excel power-user tutorials.

**Mini project**

* Clean and analyze a sample retail sales table: compute weekly sales, fill-rate, basic KPIs; deliver a one-page Excel dashboard.

---

## Stage 2 — Core Analytics (2–5 months)

**Skills**

* Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib/plotly; Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA); Tableau or Power BI; A/B test basics; time series basics.

**Courses**

* *Coursera — Supply Chain Analytics (and Supply Chain Analytics Specialization by Rutgers)* — applied analytics in a supply-chain context. ([Coursera][3])
* *MITx — Supply Chain Analytics (edX)* — focuses on regression, optimization, probability for supply chains. ([edX][4])

**Project (portfolio)**

* **Demand forecasting project**: Use the *M5 / Walmart* datasets (Kaggle) to create hierarchical forecasts for SKUs; produce point & probabilistic forecasts, evaluate with MAPE/WRMSSE; publish notebook. (See datasets below.) ([Kaggle][5])

**Deliverable**

* Jupyter notebook + readme + 1-page dashboard (Tableau or Power BI) showing forecast & inventory impact.

---

## Stage 3 — Advanced analytics & optimization (5–10 months)

**Skills**

* Time-series & probabilistic forecasting (ETS, ARIMA, Prophet, ML methods), gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM), deep learning basics for time series (TFT, LSTMs if needed).
* Optimization: linear programming, mixed integer programming (inventory policy, network flow), use solvers (PuLP, Gurobi if available).
* Simulation: discrete-event / agent simulation for warehouse/transport.

**Resources & tooling**

* **Forecasting: Principles & Practice** (Hyndman) — excellent free textbook for practice and theory. ([OTexts][6])
* **Gurobi / optimization** and enterprise solvers (Gurobi is commonly used in industry analytics stacks per analyst reviews). ([Gartner][7])

**Projects**

* Inventory optimization: create an (s,S) or (Q,R) model and compare cost/service tradeoffs; simulate using real or synthetic demand.
* Transportation routing proof-of-concept: formulate vehicle routing with capacity constraints and solve a small network.

**Deliverable**

* Python notebooks with optimization code, unit tests, and an explanation of business impact (cost saved / service improved).

---

## Stage 4 — Enterprise systems & data engineering (9–15 months)

**Skills**

* ETL pipelines, data warehouses, basics of SAP (SAP IBP/ APO), Oracle SCM, Kinaxis, Blue Yonder—knowledge of these platforms helps translate analytics to production.
* BI in production: automated refreshes, performance metrics, stakeholder reports.

**Resources**

* Read product documentation / vendor pages and vendor-specific getting-started tutorials. Common enterprise choices include SAP Integrated Business Planning, Blue Yonder, Oracle SCM, Kinaxis. Industry tool reviews & comparisons: Gartner / SGAnalytics lists. ([Gartner][7])

**Project**

* Build an ETL pipeline that ingests CSV sales, cleans it, stores in a simple PostgreSQL DW, and drives a Power BI dashboard that updates KPIs.

**Deliverable**

* GitHub repo (Airflow or simple cron), database schema, BI report example.

---

## Stage 5 — Strategy, certifications & leadership (12–24 months)

**Certifications (recommended order & why)**

1. **CPIM (APICS / ASCM)** — deep operations & inventory planning knowledge (good for inventory/planning roles). ([ASCM][1])
2. **CSCP (APICS / ASCM)** — end-to-end global supply-chain knowledge (strategic view). ([ASCM][8])
3. **SCPro™ (CSCMP)** — tiered (Levels 1–3) for end-to-end competency; good for experienced practitioners moving to leadership. ([CSCMP][9])

*(Optional but valuable: CPSM by ISM for procurement focus; vendor certificates for SAP/Blue Yonder/Kinaxis if you target specific enterprise stacks.)* ([ASCM][10])

**How to choose:** CPIM = operations & inventory focus; CSCP = strategy & global flows; SCPro = case-based leadership credential. ([ASCM][1])

---

## Stage 6 — Capstone & hiring (15–24 months)

**Capstone project ideas (see table below for more)**

* End-to-end project: forecasting → inventory policy → optimization → BI dashboard demonstrating financial impact. Use public data (M5) + synthetic supply chain lead times/costs.

**Interview prep**

* Be ready to explain end-to-end business impact (service level vs cost) and show code + dashboards. Prepare STAR stories about how analytics changed a decision.
